Utsav Kumar is a professional with experience at CRED, and has an education background from the Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow. He is located in Mumbai and has over 500 connections on LinkedIn.\n\n2. Another Utsav Kumar is the Country Director at the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and has previously held positions such as Deputy Country Director and Principal Country Economist at the Sri Lanka Resident Mission. He holds a PhD in Economics from the University of Maryland, College Park.\n\n3. There is also a Utsav Kumar who is an engineer by education and a teacher at heart, dedicated to empowering students to create meaningful change in the world, as mentioned on Creatnet Education.\n\n4. Additionally, I found a Utsav Kumar who was a former Economist in the Economics Program (Domestic and International Research Products) of The Conference Board, and his research covers topics related to economics.\n\nIt's possible that these are different individuals with the same name, or that Utsav Kumar is a multi-faceted individual with diverse experience and interests."
